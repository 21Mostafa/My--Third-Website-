        <p id="fu" >No matter what the season, tea can be a tasty beverage since it can be served iced or hot.

            But its benefits go far beyond refreshment. There is plenty of research showing that drinking tea can actually improve your health.
            
            The newest study, published Thursday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, involved more than 100,000 adults in China and found those who regularly drank tea were less likely to develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or die prematurely from any cause — particularly stroke — compared to others during a seven-year follow-up.
            
            The link was especially strong among habitual tea drinkers — those who enjoyed the beverage at least three times a week. Green tea seemed to have a stronger effect than black tea.
            
            Based on the findings, a 50-year-old frequent tea drinker might develop heart disease almost a year-and-a-half later or live about a year longer than someone who never or seldom drank tea, the study authors wrote.</p>
